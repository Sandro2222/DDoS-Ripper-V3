# DDos-Ripper-V3 (Simulation / Lab Use Only)

> **Important:** `DDos-Ripper-V3` is a *simulation and load-testing educational tool* intended **only** for use in controlled environments (local lab, test network, or systems for which you have explicit written permission). The author will **not** take responsibility for any misuse, damage, legal consequences, or unauthorized testing performed with this software.

## What is this repository?
`DDos-Ripper-V3` is a **simulation** of network stress-testing behavior designed for researchers, educators, and system administrators who want to study how services behave under heavy, *simulated* load in a safe environment. It does **not** contain or document techniques for attacking third-party networks. Use it only on networks and systems you control or where you have explicit authorization.

## Goals
- Provide an environment for learning how servers and monitoring tools react under simulated high-load conditions.
- Help developers and ops teams test autoscaling, rate-limiting, and monitoring in a controlled lab.
- Offer reproducible, measurable simulation scenarios for teaching and research.

## Features (simulation-focused)
- Predefined simulation profiles (low / medium / high) that generate non-malicious synthetic load patterns.
- Metrics collection hooks (expose Prometheus-style metrics endpoints for integration with monitoring).
- Safe mode that limits concurrency and enforces strict rate caps to avoid real-world disruption.
- Logging and replay tools for repeatable experiments.
- Exportable test results (CSV / JSON) for analysis.

## Legal & Ethical Notice
- **Do not** use this software against any system, service, or network without explicit, written authorization from the system owner.
- Running unauthorized stress tests or attacks against third-party services may be illegal in your jurisdiction and can result in civil and criminal penalties.
- The **author will not take responsibility** for any misuse, damages, legal claims, or consequences arising from use of this project.

## Installation (safe)
This project is intended to run in isolated lab environments (e.g., Docker, local VMs, private test networks).
